# SOEP

SOEP (Satellite Orbit and Event Predictor) is a website that calculates and visualizes when satellites pass a specified geographical location, collision risks between two chosen satellites, orbital trajectories, and re-entry of satellites. It offers 3D visualizations of the earth and its active satellites in real-time.
